Hi,
This is a little project that I produced for my CS150 Data Structures class here
at Lafayette.  This is for the 6th lab in the class: I'm uploading this one
to github (unlike all my others) so that I can run it on my big hexa-core
desktop instead of the ancient dual-core laptop I wrote it on.

I placed a copy of the lab in this folder: I will also have a completed
report here.  Take a look at what I'm doing with my life, if you'd like.

This program is intended to be run via BlueJ, so there is no build system.
When you run it, it will be slow: it is measuring how bad some pretty bad
algorithms get when the inputs get big.  The speed is effectivly determined
by the values you run it with.

This is licensed under the MIT license, which means that you may reuse it
as you please provided you give me credit.  Of course, the primary use for
this program is for an assignment: the only reason I'm even bothering to
specify a license is because I'll be uploading it to a public repository so
I don't need to set Github up to access a private repo on my desktop, since
I havent done so since my last Windows reinstall.

If you have any reason to belive that the name on this program does not
correspond to the person who created it, please google some lines of code
from it to try and track the author down.  Notify that individual, and
he will be happy to pursue additional sanctions against the infringer of
his legal rights.  If no results appear, check out TheMageKing on github.
He's a cool dude.
